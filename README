This is for Rails 3. It's a basic wraps around your existing Wordpress installation for posts. Comments are quite easy to do as well, but you'll have to wait for me to extract it from my application.

Interesting places to look.

app/models/Option - this is where all the permalink stuff happens. This is assuming you want to use Wordpress permalinks. I do, this way you can maintain and not break existing links. The reason I use a default permalink in the environment is so that the routes file doesn't throw an error when we're using Rake or testing.

If you want search, which you probably do, use Sunspot and Solr. They work well. There's an example sunspot config in the Post model.
